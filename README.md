# Machine Learning for Earth and Environmental Sciences course

This project is part of an evaluation of the Machine Learning course at the University of Lausanne.

The aim of my project is to predict 3 hours in advance whether a moderate convective or an extreme convective wind burt will occur.

The datasets linked to this project were preprocessed by Iat Hin Tam (iathin.tam@unil.ch) and are available to use. They are based on european winds that were recorded from 2011 to 2020. Around 10 predictors (one predictor has 2 variants : its mean and standard deviation) and 40'000 variables are available.
